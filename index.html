	<p>I am a PhD student in the Department of Political Science at Michigan State University. My substantive research interests are broadly related to violent non-state actors, terrorism, and Middle Eastern politics.</p>
	<p>I am also interested in text analysis and the use of social media in political science research. I graduated summa cum laude from the University of Kentucky with a degree in international studies.

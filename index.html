	<p>I am a PhD student in the Department of Political Science at Michigan State University. My research broadly focuses on how armed actors active in civil conflicts manage their relationships with non-combatants.</p>
	<p>I am particularly interested in how these groups use different forms of media and their effect on civilian attitudes. My projects use a variety of methods, including computational text analysis and machine learning.

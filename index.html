	<p>I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Political Science and a Cloud Computing Fellow at Michigan State University. I am also an affiliate of the Social Science Data Analytics initiative. My research broadly focuses on how armed actors involved in civil conflicts manage their relationships with non-combatants.</p>
	<p>I am particularly interested in how these groups use different forms of media and their effect on civilian attitudes. I recently returned from conducting fieldwork in Lebanon and have spent over a year in the Middle East studying Arabic.

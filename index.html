<p>Welcome! My name is Nikolaos Frantzeskakis, and I am an Assistant Professor at the Department of Political Science and 
	International Studies at the University of Birmingham. I study Comparative politics and research methods with a 
	focus on reprepsentation, elections, and legislatures in Africa.<p>
		
<p>My dissertation project studies accountability and legislative behavior in African parliaments. In particular, I am 
	interested in ways in which MPs in different electoral contexts adapt their behavior to appease party elites and voters 
	respectively. The project received the Lynne Reiner Best Dissertation Award of the African Politics Conference Group in 2024, 
	and it is currently being developed into a book project.<p>
		
<p>Data on legislative speeches are scarce for most regions, let alone Africa. To resolve this issue, I utilize advanced
	computational methods, including transformer models, to create datasets which will allow me to understand the ways 
	in which MPs position themselves towards the executive, represent  their home constituents, and prioritize among 
	various policy areas. The compiled dataset covers Ghana, Botswana, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.</p>
		
<p>I completed my undergraduate studies in Greece, where I earned my B.A. in Political Science and Public Administration from the University of Athens in 2015. I graduated from the University of Missouri with an M.A in Political Science in 2018. In 2020, I received an M.A in Political Science as well as a certificate in computational modeling from Michigan State University. I received my PhD in Political Science from Michigan State University in 2023.</p>
		
<p>My work has been published in the <i>American Political Science Review, British Journal of Political Science, Legislative Studies Quarterly, Electoral Studies, West European Politics,</i> and Oxford University Press.</p>

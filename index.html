<p>I joined the Ph.D. program in the Department of Political Science at Michigan State University in the fall of 2018.<p>
<p>My research interests lie in the field of Comparative Politics, with a regional focus on African Politics. I am particularly interested in the development of electoral institutions after regime change, election violence, and parliamentary behavior. I am especially keen on using advanced quantitative methods to investigate intriguing research questions on these topics.<p>
<p>I completed My undergraduate studies in Greece, where I earned my B.A. in Political Science and Public Administration form the University of Athens in 2015. I also graduated from the University of Missouri with an M.A in Political Science in 2018.</p>

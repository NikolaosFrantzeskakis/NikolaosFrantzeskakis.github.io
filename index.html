<p>Welcome! My name is Nikolaos Frantzeskakis, and I am a Ph.D. candidate in Political Science at Michigan State University. 
	I study Comparative politics and research methods with a focus on elections and legislatures in Africa.<p>
		
<p>My dissertation project focuses on legislative behavior. I study how reelection pressures affect speechmaking on the floor 
	of parliament. Also, I explore how they resolve the dual principal dilemma which they face as they need to be responsive 
	to both their constituents and the party leadership. Finally, I look at the extent to which such information reaches the 
	public and informs their vote choice.<p>
		
<p>Data on legislative speeches are scarce for most regions, let alone Africa. To resolve this issue, I take advantage of modern 
	computational methods and recent advances in text analysis. I utilize transformer models to create datasets using supervised 
	learning. The compiled a dataset covers Ghana, Botswana, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe, and it includes variables on 
	policy topics, and sentiment, among others.</p>
		
<p>I completed my undergraduate studies in Greece, where I earned my B.A. in Political Science and Public Administration from the 
	University of Athens in 2015. I graduated from the University of Missouri with an M.A in Political Science in 2018. In 2020, 
	I received an M.A in Political Science as well as a certificate in computational modeling from Michigan State University.</p>
		
<p>My work has been published in the <i>American Political Science Review, Electoral Studies, West European Politics,</i> and Oxford University Press.</p>

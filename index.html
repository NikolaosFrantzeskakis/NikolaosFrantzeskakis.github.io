<p>Welcome! My name is Nikolaos Frantzeskakis, and I am a Ph.D. candidate in Political Science at Michigan State University. 
	I study Comparative politics and research methods with a focus on elections and legislatures in Africa.<p>
		
<p> In my dissertation project, I study accountability and legislative behavior in African parliaments. In particular, I am 
	interested in ways in which MPs in different electoral contexts adapt their behavior to appease party elites and voters 
	respectively.<p>
		
<p>Data on legislative speeches are scarce for most regions, let alone Africa. To resolve this issue, I take advantage of modern 
	computational methods and recent advances in text analysis. I utilize transformer models to create datasets which will 
	allow me to understand the ways in which MPs position themselves towards the executive, represent  their home constituents, 
	and prioritize among various policy areas. The compiled dataset covers Ghana, Botswana, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.</p>
		
<p>I completed my undergraduate studies in Greece, where I earned my B.A. in Political Science and Public Administration from the 
	University of Athens in 2015. I graduated from the University of Missouri with an M.A in Political Science in 2018. In 2020, 
	I received an M.A in Political Science as well as a certificate in computational modeling from Michigan State University.</p>
		
<p>My work has been published in the <i>American Political Science Review, Electoral Studies, West European Politics,</i> and Oxford University Press.</p>

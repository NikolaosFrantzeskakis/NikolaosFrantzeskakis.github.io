	We collect an original corpus of official documents released by Hezbollah and use text analysis to create a 
	measure of their relationships with other non-state groups. Despite recent research that demonstrates these 
	types of relationships affect the length and severity of conflict, data limitations hinder efforts by researchers 
	to capture important variation in them over time. Our approach uses fine-grained text data to capture dynamic 
	trends in these relationships. We demonstrate its effectiveness by showing our model is able to reproduce 
	qualitative accounts of Hezbollah’s known alliances and rivalries with other non-state actors with greater 
	accuracy and precision than existing measures. We also compare the approach with event data and demonstrate 
	its ability to provide more granular and complementary information. With further exploration, this technique 
	could assist researchers in improving and developing measures of intrastate cooperation and competition for 
	use in empirical analyses.

	Grievance and opportunity theories have dominated research on the causes of civil war for half a century, 
		with much of the existing literature focused on determining which is a better predictor of conflict 
		onset. We argue that this focus limits existing research’s ability to explain variation in civil 
		conflict onset. Rather than treating grievance and opportunity as independent, competing explanations,
		we integrate them into a unified theory, arguing that they are best understood as complements that 
		jointly predict conflict. We apply insights from the interstate war literature, arguing that the 
		probability of civil war increases as the disparity between relative power and the status quo 
		distribution of benefits (conceptualized as inverse grievances) increases. Under these conditions,
		relatively powerful actors have incentives to use force to obtain greater benefits. Data regarding
		541 ethnic group-state dyads in 127 countries provide strong statistical and substantive support for
		our theoretical argument.

	<p><div style="margin-left: 1em;">
	How do religious holidays affect the incidence of terror attacks? I argue multiple incentives exist that 
		encourage violence on these days. For example, attacks on holidays allow terrorists to signal their
		religiosity and impose extra terror on their targets. Governments understand they are triggers for
		violence though and increase security surrounding them. However, their ability to do this is limited
		by the length of the holiday due to resource constraints and practical concerns. I consequently expect
		the probability of an attack occurring on holidays that last a few days to be lower than on non-holidays
		since state security is at its peak. However, holidays that last weeks are more difficult to protect and
		still provide payoffs to terror groups. They should therefore have a higher likelihood of witnessing an
		attack than non-holidays. Data from all available Arab League countries (2001-2016) support these claims.
